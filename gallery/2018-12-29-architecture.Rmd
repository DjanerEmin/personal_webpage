I am passionate about architecture. Can't say I know all the styles and movements but I tend to appreaciate a beautiful building. After all buidings are to us what a nice rock wall overlooking an open plane is to the Golden Eagle - they are our 'environment'. If we are bound to live in and out of buildings we might as well appreciate them...
