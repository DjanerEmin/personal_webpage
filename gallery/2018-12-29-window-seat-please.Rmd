I am a child of globalization. This means hours and hours of air time using low-cost companies visiting friends, family, or attending conferences. This is a compilation of photos during such trips across Europe. Some nice shots were possible especially when the weather played along. 

The tutle of this collection was stolen from [Tao Ruspoli](https://www.taoruspoli.com), a photographer and indie movie producer from the US whos work I really appreciate.
